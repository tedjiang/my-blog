This is a course project where we used LCA to analyze the environmental impact of produce packaging. Although plastic packaging has gained negative reputation due to its various environmental impacts, it also provides valuable function of extending produce shelflife, which could reduce food waste. In this project we evaluated if modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) is environmentally beneficial to three fresh produces--asparagus, bell pepper, and tomato. See the [project article](/pdf_files/ProducePackagingLCA.pdf) for detailed results and discussion.
