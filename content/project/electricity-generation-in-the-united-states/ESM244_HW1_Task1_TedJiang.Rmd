This project will explore the electricity generation plants in the United States and their air pollutants and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. There are three parts in this porject.  
Part one explores the average electricity GHG emission factor on a state level and how they are affected by the electricty mix in different state (renewable-to-total and natural-gas-to-fossil-fuel). In carbon accounting, this is called **scope II emission**.  
Part two explores the generation plants in ten most populated states, and their total $NO_x$, $SO_2$, and GHG emission in 2018.  
Part three explores the electricity generation and emissions for California counties in 2018.

#### **Part One.** The average electricity GHG emission factor on a state level.

**Table 1. 2018 Electricity Generation and Emission for California Counties.** Total $NO_x$ And $SO_2$ emission, total net generation amount, and corresponding emission factor are shown in the table. If the emission factor for a pollutant type is higher than California average, it is marked as yellow. Otherwise, it is marked as green. (Source: eGrid, 2018)
