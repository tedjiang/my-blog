<p>I have been thinking about this little infograph I made when taking the data visualization class at Bren. It was about parrot poaching. Conservation is not really my specialty, but I thought parrots are just such fascinating creatures and wanted to learn something about them. I took sometime find out the details with this small project and attached it here.
The write up after the infographic were written in 2019.</p>
