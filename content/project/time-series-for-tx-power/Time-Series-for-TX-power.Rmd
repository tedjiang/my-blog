As the biggest state in the US, Texas generates significant amounts of electricity every year. As a state traditionally depending on fossil fuel, the generation mix has been changing in recent years. This project will explore the geographic distribution of TX power plants in 2018, the seasonal change of generation amount for four main generation types, and the generation mix change from 2001 to 2018.

* Traditional large plants like coal, gas, and nuclear concentrate in the east region of the state.
* Small scale wind plants concentrates in the north and south region of the state.

* Gas, coal and nuclear show strong seasonality.
* The seasonality for wind is less obvious.
* Coal shows a trend of decreasing.
* Wind shows a trend of increasing.

**Figure 5. Season Plots for Coal, Gas, Nuclear, and Wind Generation in TX.** A season plot shows the change of the generation in one year. Each line in the plot represents one year, indicated by the color scale. (Source: US EIA, 2020) 
  
* For coal and gas, the generation pattern in one year follows the common pattern of high electricity demand in summer. As a result, the generation increases significantly during summer months to guarantee supply.
* However, nuclear and wind do not show such pattern, probably due to their continous generation characteristics and dependence on weather. In fact, the lack of flexibility is usually considered as a disadvantage of renewable powers.
* There are two significant generation drops for nuclear in October and April. This is probably due to the annual shutdown of the reactors.
* Similarly, the season plot indicates the decreasing of coal generation and the increasing of wind generation.
