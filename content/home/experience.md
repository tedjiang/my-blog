  * Performed LCA in the context of wide-ranging projects and performing detailed calculations to find material flows, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, ecological footprints, and other environmental, economic, and social metrics
  * Analyzed the feasibility and decarbonization potential of state-of-art and emerging technologies in various industries for sustainable supply chain management
  * Developed a GHG abatement model based on an existing Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA) model, which would provide scientific estimates on how supply technology intervention would affect the company’s Scope 3 carbon footprint; the model would help the client understand the carbon hotspots in the supply chain, and develop a science-based supply chain decarbonization strategy 
  * Performed Carbon Accounting for various organizations (scope 1, 2 and 3)
  * Improved environmental database management, including data collection, database maintenance, and environmental data modeling
  * As a team member, reviewed and published a review article on LCA for plastics through National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
