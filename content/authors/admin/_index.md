bio: 客亦知夫水與月乎？逝者如斯，而未嘗往也；盈虛者如彼，而卒莫消長也。蓋將自其變者而觀之，則天地曾不能以一瞬；自其不變者而觀之，則物與我皆無盡也，而又何羨乎？ 且夫天地之間，物各有主，茍非吾之所有，雖一毫而莫取。惟江上之清風，與山間之明月，耳得之而為聲，目遇之而成色，取之無禁，用之不竭，是造物者之無盡藏也，而吾與子之所共食。   --蘇軾《赤壁賦》<br /><br /> Do you happen to know the nature of water or the moon? Water is always on the run like this, but never lost in its course; the moon always waxes and wanes like that, but never out of its sphere. When viewed from a changing perspective, the universe can hardly be the same even within a blink of an eye, But when looked at from an unchanging perspective, everything conserves itself, and so do we. Therefore, what’s in them to be admired? Besides, in this universe, everything has its rightful owner. If something does not belong to you, then you shall not even have a bit of it. Only the refreshing breeze on the river and the bright moon over the hills are an exception. If you can hear it, it is a sound to you; if you can see it, it is a view to you. It never ends and is never exhausted. It is the infinite treasure granted to us by our Creator for both of us to enjoy.   -- Su Shi, _Ode to the Red Cliff_

Experienced Environmental Engineer dedicated to helping organizations achieve responsible growth and sustainability excellence. I integrate data-driven decision-making with risk-based management systems to deliver long-term success and measurable impacts. I have 10 years of experience providing environmental sustainability solutions in various industries including innovative food and fiber, bio-based materials, textile, electronics and ICT, and AI datacenter hardware manufacturing. I specialize in environmental impact assessment, environmental compliance, ISO 14001 Environmental Management System, decarbonization strategy, and audit program management. When not working, I like to read-- mainly non-fictions. We have a Border Collie called Molly, she is adorable and needs lots of attention, so I try to do that too.
