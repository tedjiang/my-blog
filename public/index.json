Is it because that meat is delicious? Or is it because you think meat is good for your health? A group of psychologists’ findings will provide you with a new answer- that people sometimes consume meat to secure their gender identity.\nHistorically, meat consumption has been connected to gender identity. You might still remember your high school history class about pre-historic societies. The white-beard harsh-looking historical teacher told you how men acted as hunters and women acted as gatherers at that time.\nNow this connection has been proved scientifically. Mr. Rothgerber and his co-workers at Bellarmine University, UK find that eating meat makes men feel like a “real man.” This is shown by a positive correspondence between men’s meat consumption and their self-identity of masculinity.\nFirst, Mr. Rothgerber shows us that men do like meat more than women. By studying 86 high school students, he finds that men’s meat consumption is higher than women, and there are more female vegetarians than male ones. When justifying their meat consumption, men are more unapologetic while women are not. The top three strategies for male are pro-meat, health justification and hierarchical justification. This means their main arguments are “meat is good in general,” “meat is keeping me healthy,” and “human is superior to animals.” However, for women, the top three methods are disassociating meat-eating from animal suffering, disconnecting meat from animal, and differentiating farm animals from household pets. They are avoiding the problem!\nMr. Rothgerber thinks that these differences in justification strategy might be caused by the tradition that men refuse to show weakness. In stereotype gender image, men should be tough and restrained, and showing empathy on animal suffering would be considered as weak and sensitive. To prove this assumption, Mr. Rothgerber uses a widely accepted psychological tool to test the participants’ masculinity score and compares the score with their diets. The result for men is as expected: eating beef, chicken, pork, and fish all show positive relationships with masculinity, among which beef has the highest masculinity score; having a vegetarian diet shows a negative relationship with masculinity.\nUnfortunately, meat consumption is not very environmental-friendly. A study in 2012 found that a healthy vegetarian diet will generate 0.7 tons of carbon emission less than a regular one provided by a national guideline. With all these findings, it proves that the belief in masculinity is harming our environment.\nAttitude towards meat consumption is not the first time masculinity prevents men from being pro-environment. Another group at Utah State University studied the relationship between “being environmental” and “being feminine”. They found that when the name of a non-profit organization is Wilderness Rangers, they get more donations from men, compared to the name of Friends of Nature. Also, if men feel that their masculinity is secured before going to a grocery store (e.g., telling them that they “write like a man”), they are more likely to purchase environmental items during shopping.\nThese studies are important not because they reveal the inner secrets of why some men are averse to environmental products and services, but because they provide us some guidelines for designing our green products and strategies in the future. We do not really have the time to wait for every man to find a resolution between becoming environmental-friendly and feeling masculine. Why not make pro-environment efforts more tough and rugged, so men feel less demasculinized?\nHowever, you can always ask an unapologetic meat-eater guy: “How much beef do you need to eat to feel like a man?”\nReferences:\n* Brough, Aaron R. et al. “The Green-Feminine Stereotype and Its Effect on Sustainable Consumption.” Journal of Consumer Research 43.4 (2016): 567–582.

Season Plots for Coal, Gas, Nuclear, and Wind Generation in TX. A season plot shows the change of the generation in one year. Each line in the plot represents one year, indicated by the color scale. (Source: US EIA, 2020)\n For coal and gas, the generation pattern in one year follows the common pattern of high electricity demand in summer. As a result, the generation increases significantly during summer months to guarantee supply. However, nuclear and wind do not show such pattern, probably due to their continous generation characteristics and dependence on weather. In fact, the lack of flexibility is usually considered as a disadvantage of renewable powers. There are two significant generation drops for nuclear in October and April. This is probably due to the annual shutdown of the reactors. Similarly, the season plot indicates the decreasing of coal generation and the increasing of wind generation.   Reference: CBS News.

This declaration has created a lot of concerns that U.S. policy will fail to address climate change and support energy transition in the future. This essay will introduce an equilibrium-and-fluctuation model of American politics and use this model to analyze the climate policy change in recent decades. Finally, this essay will argue that the declaration will actually promote climate policy development, considering the bipartisan characteristics of American politics, policy diffusion under federalism, and the agenda-setting process through media coverage and public opinion.\nEquilibrium and fluctuation model of the U.S. bipartisan political system\nMajor policy change usually happens slowly in America with its fundamental rule-making institution and bipartisan nature. In the legislative branch, it is required that the majority of Congress need to vote to pass certain legislation, which introduces multiple veto players such as House median voter, Senate median voter, and Senate filibuster. These players create a gridlock where policy cannot be moved. At the time when one party controls both the House and the Senate, some policies may be able to move to one direction due to the shrunk gridlock, but these policies will usually go back to the mid when the other party gains control again. In the executive branch, the President can break the gridlock and make changes by issuing executive orders. However, future presidents can also easily reverse these changes via the same process. Similarly, in the legislative branch, the legal decision of the Supreme Court seldom inclines to one party, since both sides of Congress will avoid such a situation.\nHence, policies in the U.S. usually fluctuates around an equilibrium state through negative feedback. Whenever one party moves a policy to one side, the other party will soon move it back to the equilibrium. Baumgartner F. R. and Jones B. D. (1993, p.15) argue that the equilibrium is stable if the institutions of rule-making do not change and the definition of a certain issue under such institutions does not change. Rule-making institution change requires a fundamental political structure change, which is unlikely to happen in developed countries. Therefore, a definition change of a certain issue would be the common reason for major policy shifts.\nThe mechanism of such a policy shift is “a bigger fluctuation.” In system science, an equilibrium system tends to stay in the status quo with any minor perturbations. However, when the perturbation is big enough, the old negative feedback would turn to positive feedback, creating an avalanche effect and pushing the system to a new equilibrium. In my opinion, a similar mechanism also works in political science. A definition change would create multiple institution changes. While the results of these institutions changes create benefits for the majority of the stakeholders, they will further consolidate the institutional changes, thus creating positive feedback. An example the supports this model is the historical change of renewable energy policy in Germany and the U.S. Laird F. N. and Stefes C. (2009) compared the renewable energy policy in the two countries. They argued that in Germany, with the high cost of coal mining and intensive public concern of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the two major competitors of renewable power lost their supports in the late 1980s. This created a window for policymakers in Germany to intensively promote renewable power by introducing feed-in tariff (FIT) policy– a governmental subsidy on the renewable energy industry. FIT significantly accelerated the development of German renewable industry. This industrial growth pushed public opinion more favorable to renewables, making conservative parties reluctant to reverse the policy.\nOn the other hand, policymakers in the U.S. lacked the motivation to push renewables. First, the coal industry in the U.S. was still at its prime time in the late 1980s (EIA, 2012). Second, Mideastern oil crisis did create some anxiety, but the Bush Administration put more efforts in promoting fossil fuel rather than renewables. With the oil price decreased after several years, the window for American renewable policy change closed.\nMassachusetts v. EPA, and the Obama Administration’s climate policy\nJoining the Paris Agreement is a crucial part of the Obama Administration’s climate policy. This section will discuss the Obama Administration’s climate policy after the 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA supreme court case and analyze how they fit into the model discussed above.\nThe Massachusetts v. EPA case is a typical example of the definition change of a specific issue under existing institutions, thus opening a window for major policy shifts. In 2007, the State of Massachusetts argued that greenhouse gases should be qualified as air pollutants and regulated by the EPA under the Clean Air Act. The State filed a lawsuit against the EPA, and this case went all the way to the Supreme Court, which finally decided that the EPA has the responsibility to regulate greenhouse gases (Massachusetts v. EPA, 2007).\nThe case then became the Obama Administration’s reference to push aggressive climate policies. Joining the Paris Agreement and the Clean Power Plan (CPP) are two major achievements among these policies. However, both of them were implemented via executive power of the President. This means that they did not get approval from the Congress and can be easily reversed by new executive orders from the following presidents, which is exactly what is happening in the current Trump Administration. Hence, the Paris Agreement and the CPP are still fluctuations around the equilibrium.\nHowever, there are some fundamental differences in these fluctuations. First of all, the fluctuations are bigger. This is shown by an unusual dysfunction of federalism which leads to sharper conflicts between the two parties. Konisky D. M. and Woods N. D. (2016) noticed the more frequent governmental overreach of the Obama Administration. It is estimated that about fifty federal environmental regulation plans were issued to the state level, far more than the Bush Administration and the Clinton Administration. At the same time, conservative states showed more protests against the federal environmental regulations. Multiple litigations against the Obama EPA were filed, arguing that it did not follow its regulation-setting role. Another example is the trend of leaving regional cap and trade program in some states with Republican governors. In 2011, former Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie declared that New Jersey would leave the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI)—a voluntary inter-state cap and trade program in the New England region (RGGI, inc., 2011). Interestingly, with the newly elected Democratic Governor Phil Murray, New Jersey now plans to rejoin the RGGI (NJ DEP, 2018).\nSecond, plans like the CPP is required by existing institutions. With the Massachusetts v. EPA case, if the Trump Administration wants to reverse the CPP, they must propose a substitution plan. In 2018, EPA proposed the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule. ACE emphasizes more on heat-rate efficiency improvement and gives the states more flexibility to develop their own plans (US EPA, 2018). However, with intensive questions on if the ACE could reduce greenhouse gas emission, there will possibly be more evaluations and even litigations on it. This shows that with an institutional definition change, attempts to reverse climate policy are harder than before.\nHence, as observed above, although the climate policy changes in the Obama Administration still fall into the fluctuation around the equilibrium, they also display a set of unstable characteristics. According to the equilibrium and fluctuation model discussed in the previous section, the unstable features could be a sign that the climate policy equilibrium is starting to shift.\n“A Bigger Fluctuation,” and the Trump Administration’s Climate Policy\nWith the context set, there is a now different perspective to view President Trump declaration of leaving the Paris Agreement. By using the model, this section will discuss how the declaration turns out to push more stringent and innovative climate policies mostly in the state level and what is the mechanism behind this process.\nThe declaration itself is just another normal fluctuation around the equilibrium, but its media influence is far bigger than normal. The global media coverage on climate change in June 2017 when the declaration happened went up about 46% compared to May 2017, while in North America, media coverage is twice the amount of May 2017 (Boykoff et al., 2017). Intensive media coverage of this spotlight incident brought climate change to the public’s attention again.\nFurthermore, despite the negative attitude towards climate change of the incident, public opinions seem still in favor of climate policy. McGarth L. F. and Bernauer T.’s (2017) research indicates that climate policy has high support rates in the U.S., and this support rate is insensitive to the underlying cost and possible free-riding problem. Tingley D. and Tomz M.’s (2014) work shows similar results, arguing that the majority of the public thinks that their country should have unconditional commitments to solving climate change. Hence, with the vast media coverage and the supportive public opinion, it is predictable that climate policy will be brought on the agenda more frequently, thus creating more possibility for new climate policies. In the federal level, due to the gridlock in Congress, such policies might still be hard to be passed, but in the state level, new climate policies will be more promising. An example of this is the new renewable portfolio standard (NPS) for California. On September 10th , 2018, Californian Democratic Governor Jerry Brown issued an executive order, promising the state will be 100 percent clean energy by 2045 (CA Exe. Order, 2018). Also, there has been an on-going discussion in the Oregon legislative branch, trying to pass the Clean Energy Jobs Bill. If passed, the law will introduce a cap and trade program to Oregon (OR Legis. Assemb., 2019). In the federal level, new policies are also emerging. On February 7th , 2019, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez released the outline of a new policy proposal— “Green New Deal.” The package includes climate resiliency, infrastructure upgrade, renewable energy transition, and increasing energy efficiency, etc. (H.R. Con., 2019)\nHowever, these new policies are more stringent and innovative than usual, showing a “bigger fluctuation” characteristic. The new NPS in California is ambitious in terms of achieving 100 percent renewable energy in such a short term. The “Green New Deal” combines climate policy and economy policy in one package, looking for supports from both parties. Policymakers supporting climate policy are now thinking out of the box.\nOn the other hand, conservative policymakers are confined by the revised Clean Air Act. The review of the ACE is still under process, so the only thing they can do is to wait and to prepare for possible turn-down of the ACE. The space they can move around in terms of climate policy is very limited right now.\nHence, while two parties are still combating in the climate policy arena, Democrats have more potential to introduce new policies especially in the state level, thus breaking the old equilibrium.\nPredictions on the Future Climate Policy Change\nFinally, it is important to understand how these new emerging policies could lead to a federal level climate policy shift. This section will discuss a possible mechanism of policy diffusion among states, and how this diffusion could ultimately lead to federal policy change.\nPoliticians typically vote based on three factors– party, ideology, and constituency. With the polarization between two parties right now, votes from conservative Republicans in any states will be hard to get. However, in the swing states, the polarization should be less severe than usual, meaning that there will be more moderates Republicans and Democrats legislators. These legislators do not weigh the Party factor too much, and their ideology tends to be more mixed. Hence, constituency will be a more important consideration for them when voting for a certain policy. If the liberal states which are adopting new climate policies can show robust economic growth in the long term, public opinion in the swing states could also incline to support such policies. For example, in the states where coal jobs are degrading, policy-induced renewable job growth in another state may incentivize local workers to ask for similar policies, thus shifting the constituency. For electoral consideration, the moderate voters in the state will start to support similar policies in the state legislative branch.\nAt this point, a positive feedback has already started. With swing states getting on board with climate policies, conservative states could start to change too, ultimately influencing Congress legislation and shifting federal level climate policies. Similar policy diffusion appeared frequently in the past. For example, historical Californian regulations on motor vehicle emissions turned out to affect federal regulation design (Konisky, D. M., \u0026amp; Woods, N. D., 2016). Also, this might explain the failure of American Clean Energy and Security Act (ACES). Voted in 2009, the Act never passed the filibuster veto in the Senate. ACES came out only three years after the Assembly Bill 32 (AB32) in California. Without enough time to display AB32’s effect on the economy, voters from the other states could be more hesitant when making decisions.\nIn summary, President Trump’s declaration of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement could potentially accelerate federal level climate policy change. First of all, the media effects it induced keep the climate policy on the agenda. The resistance it created intensified the climate policy fluctuations which have grown stronger since the Obama Administration. Secondly, while Democratic states are getting more stringent and innovative in climate policy design, Republican states are confined by the revised Clean Air Act. Finally, the successful implementation of climate policy in some states could diffuse to other states, creating a positive feedback. This positive feedback could ultimately urge a federal level climate policy change, shifting the equilibrium.\nReference:\n Baumgartner, F. R., \u0026amp; Jones, B. D. (1993).

Circular economy suggests that environmental impacts can be reduced by sourcing wastes rather than virgin materials. However, this claim remains largely untested. This project works with Apeel Sciences, a small biotechnology startup interested in sourcing food waste as an input to their product, to evaluate the environmental impacts of sourcing waste using two different Life Cycle Assessment methodologies, economic allocation and substitution. We show that economic allocation may not capture impacts outside the immediate system of interest, which we demonstrate can be as large if not larger than those generated by the immediate system. This is particularly true when the “waste” under consideration is not truly a waste and has another established use. Therefore, using different methodologies results in different recommendations of what to source based on environmental impacts, highlighting that sourcing wastes may not be as sustainable as originally thought. We distill these findings into a comprehensive framework that allows companies to replicate our analysis and develop a more holistic understanding of the environmental impacts of sourcing a waste.\nSee the final report for more info.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0ca46d1e00ea80ff463a50d72c2b0d8e","permalink":"/project/using-food-waste-to-reduce-food-waste/untitled/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/using-food-waste-to-reduce-food-waste/untitled/","section":"project","summary":"This project is a group project which leads to the acquisition of the degree of Master of Environmental Science and Management for the Bren School of Environmental Science \u0026amp; Management, University of California, Santa Barbara.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluating the Impacts of Sourcing Food Waste as a Raw Material for Production","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" This project will explore the potential correlations of mineral nutrients contents in meat products, using the food nutrient information dataset from United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) (USDA, 2019).

Principal Component Analysis Biplot Showing Mineral Nutrients Contents Associations in Meat Products. Principal component 1 and principal component 2 together can expalin 42.89% of the data variance. Color of the points indicates the type of the meat (Source: USDA, 2019).\nTake-aways from the biplot: In meat products, mineral nutrients usually have a positive correlation with each other. This means that when a product is rich in one mineral nutrient, it is usually rich in other nutirents too. However, this correlation can be stronger for some nutrients, while neglegible for others.\n Four pairs of mineral nutrients–calcium/magnesium, phosphorus/selenium, iron/copper, and zinc/manganese–have strong correlations within each pair. For example, if a product is rich in calcium, it is predicted that it is also rich in magnesium.\n On top of the four pairs, the mineral nutrients can also be separated into two groups–one with calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and selenium, while the other one with iron, copper, zinc, and manganese. The nutrients within each group have relatively strong correlation with each other.\n The correlation between calcium and zinc/manganese is very weak, meaning that the richness of calcium is predicted to not affect the richness of zinc or manganese. Products from the same food group are usually clustered together, meaning that meat of the same type usually have similar nutrients content with each other.   Reference: USDA. (2019).
